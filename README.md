# planner

A simple planner I use each morning to plan my day. Quick react project I'd actually use to learn the basics.

## Usage

* spin up locally with `npm run react-start`
* build locally with `npm run react-build`
* build an electron version with `npm run build`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
